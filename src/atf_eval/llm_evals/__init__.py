"""LLM / multimodal evaluation metrics -- METRICS.md Part B, Groups 1-5.

These are independent of the deterministic ATF pipeline (NTS/STS/TIS/RS/OS):
they read the same NormalizedTurn evidence but score conversation-quality,
grounding, safety and voice dimensions via an LLM judge, and preserve native
per-metric scoring (METRICS.md §19 -- no cross-metric normalization).

Entry point:

    from atf_eval.llm_evals import build_context, evaluate_conversation, get_judge_client

    client = get_judge_client()                 # None -> every metric N/A, no calls
    ctx = build_context(cid, golden_turns, observed_turns)
    report = evaluate_conversation(ctx, client)
